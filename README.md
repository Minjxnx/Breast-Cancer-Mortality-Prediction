# Breast-Cancer-Mortality-Prediction

The Real-world Problem Description
A) The Domain
The deployment of machine learning modelling in this coursework aims to tackle a real-world tool by
developing effective early screening machine learning models for breast cancer mortality and survival
prediction to help doctors enhance their treatment planning and management.
Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Breast cancer is a disease in which
abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread
throughout the body and become fatal. Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milkproducing lobules of the breast.
In females in the UK, breast cancer is the 2nd most common cause of cancer death, with around 11,400
deaths every year (2017-2019). In males in the UK, breast cancer is not among the 20 most common causes
of cancer death, with around 85 deaths every year (2017-2019).
Stages and grades of breast cancer
The tests and scans the patient have to diagnose breast cancer give information about:
• the size of the cancer and whether it has spread (the stage)
• how abnormal the cells look under the microscope (the grade)
Knowing the stage and grade helps doctor plan the patient’s treatment. The stage of a cancer tells the patient
how big it is and whether it has spread. It helps the doctor decide which treatment the patient need.
There are different systems used in the UK to stage breast cancer. The most common one is the TNM
system. TNM stands for Tumour, Node and Metastasis. the patient might also be told about the number
staging system. There are 4 main stages in this system, from 1 to 4.
The tests the patient has also give information about the type of breast cancer they have.
The information below is an overview of the TNM staging for all types of cancer.
• T describes the size of the tumour (cancer)
• N describes whether there are any cancer cells in the nearby lymph nodes
• M describes whether the cancer has spread to parts of the body further away from where the cancer started
