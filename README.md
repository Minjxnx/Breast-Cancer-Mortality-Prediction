# Breast-Cancer-Mortality-Prediction

The Real-world Problem Description

A) The Domain

The deployment of machine learning modelling in this coursework aims to tackle a real-world tool by
developing effective early screening machine learning models for breast cancer mortality and survival
prediction to help doctors enhance their treatment planning and management.
Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Breast cancer is a disease in which
abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread
throughout the body and become fatal. Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or the milkproducing lobules of the breast.
In females in the UK, breast cancer is the 2nd most common cause of cancer death, with around 11,400
deaths every year (2017-2019). In males in the UK, breast cancer is not among the 20 most common causes
of cancer death, with around 85 deaths every year (2017-2019).

Stages and grades of breast cancer

The tests and scans the patient have to diagnose breast cancer give information about:

• the size of the cancer and whether it has spread (the stage)

• how abnormal the cells look under the microscope (the grade)

Knowing the stage and grade helps doctor plan the patient’s treatment. The stage of a cancer tells the patient
how big it is and whether it has spread. It helps the doctor decide which treatment the patient need.
There are different systems used in the UK to stage breast cancer. The most common one is the TNM
system. TNM stands for Tumour, Node and Metastasis. the patient might also be told about the number
staging system. There are 4 main stages in this system, from 1 to 4.
The tests the patient has also give information about the type of breast cancer they have.
The information below is an overview of the TNM staging for all types of cancer.

• T describes the size of the tumour (cancer)

• N describes whether there are any cancer cells in the nearby lymph nodes

• M describes whether the cancer has spread to parts of the body further away from where the cancer started

Stage 1 

breast cancer means that the cancer is small and only in the
breast tissue or it might be found in lymph nodes close to the breast
(see Figure 1). It is an early-stage breast cancer.
The stage of cancer tells the patient how big it is and how far it has
spread. It helps the doctor decide the best treatment for the
patient. There are different systems used in the UK to stage breast
cancer. Stage 1 is part of the number staging system. Doctors may also
use the TNM staging system.
Staging for breast cancer is very complex. Many different factors are
considered before doctors can confirm the patient’s final stage.

Stage 2 

breast cancer means that the cancer is either in the breast or in the
nearby lymph nodes or both. It is an early-stage breast cancer.
Stage 2 is part of the number staging system. Doctors may also use the TNM
staging system.
Stage 2 can be divided into 2A and 2B. Opposite is a simplified description
of stage 2A and 2B breast cancer

Stage 3 

means that the cancer has spread from the breast to the lymph
nodes close to the breast, to the skin of the breast or to the chest wall. It is
also called locally advanced breast cancer. Stage 3 is part of the number
staging system. Doctors may also use the TNM staging system.
Stage 3 can be divided into 3A, 3B and 3C. opposite is a simplified description of
stage 3A, 3B and 3C breast cancer

Stage 4 

breast cancer has spread to another part of the body (see Figure 4). It is also
called advanced cancer or secondary breast cancer. The aim of treatment is to control
the cancer and any symptoms. Treatment depends on a number of factors.
In stage 4 breast cancer:

• the cancer can be any size

• the lymph nodes may or may not contain cancer cells

• the cancer has spread (metastasised) to other parts of the body such as the bones,lungs, liver or brain.

Hormonal Treatment

Hormone therapy is a common treatment for secondary breast cancer. It can often shrink and control the
cancer wherever it is in the body. It works well if the cancer cells have particular proteins called hormone
receptors, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor.
If one hormone therapy stops working so well, the doctor might suggest you try a different one.
Other Treatment
Doctor will take many different factors into account when deciding which treatment is best for the
patient. These include:

• the type of cells the cancer started in

• which part of your body the cancer has spread to

• the treatment you have already had

• your general health

• whether the patient have had the menopause.

• whether the cancer is growing slowly or more quickly

• whether the cancer cells have receptors for particular cancer drugs

If your cancer doesn't have hormone receptors or has spread to the liver or lungs, the doctor might suggest
Chemotherapy. Radiotherapy might be recommended if the cancer has spread to the bones or the skin near
the breast. Targeted and immunotherapy drugs might be recommended for secondary breast cancer.
